 It has aimed to improve the tourism activities in the country and also reduce the rate of robbery in different areas within the country by providing employment opportunity to both undergraduate and graduates students who can be identified by local goverment so as build trust with tourist interms of security.

 The application will also stimulate the tourism sector, as we all learn from experience, so when tourist visit Tanzania and receive a good service through our application that will be good story telling. so others will be motivated to visit Tanzania.
